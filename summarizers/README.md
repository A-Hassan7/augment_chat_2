- create summaries of rooms
- general room summary
- person specific summary
  - quirks
  - insult material
  - inside jokes
- what's the goal?
- these summaries are supposed to inform the main prompt which creates joke suggestions
- perhaps start with the joke suggestion prompt first then
- create a simple prompt, workout what summaries/info it'll require, then work backwards from there
